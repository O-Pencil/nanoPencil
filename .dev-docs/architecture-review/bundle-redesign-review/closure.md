# P7 Bundle Redesign Closure

```yaml
review_id: bundle-redesign-review
phase: P7
status: closed-as-gated
closed_at: 2026-06-07
code_scope:
  implemented:
    - BR01 package-boundary guard
    - BR05 strip embedded runtime-lib .d.ts from tarball (2026-06-10)
    - BR04 esbuild per-file minify (transpile-only, NO bundle) (2026-06-11)
  measured_not_pursued:
    - BR02 browser asset move (2026-06-11 → ~1% of install footprint, kept bundled for seamless UX)
    - BR03 model metadata chunking (2026-06-10 → ~0 win, sync API forces eager parse)
```

## Closure Verdict

P7 should close as a **gated review and package-boundary hardening slice**, not as a broad bundle rewrite.

The beta.2-beta.6 loop proved that the urgent problem was not "too many bytes"; it was unstable package ownership:

```text
public packages                 -> npm semver dependencies
private core/lib runtime libs    -> host-embedded dist/node_modules packages
optional capabilities            -> UX-first extension decisions, not raw asset moves
build pipeline                   -> measured target before replacement
```

BR01 fixed the load-bearing release boundary. BR02-BR04 now have explicit gates and should not proceed without new evidence.

## Final Finding State

| Finding | State | Decision |
|---------|-------|----------|
| [BR01](./findings/BR01-package-boundary-hardening.md) | implemented | Keep public package vs embedded-private-lib guard. This is the only P7 code slice accepted now. |
| [BR02](./findings/BR02-browser-asset-optionalization.md) | measured-kept-bundled | Browser domain-skills (1.6M/359K gzip) are ~1% of the ~275M install footprint; on-demand download is rejected to keep the networked browser feature seamless (no perceived secondary install). See 2026-06-11 addendum. |
| [BR03](./findings/BR03-model-metadata-chunking.md) | reviewed-metrics-gated | Do not split `models.generated.ts` because of line count. Require startup/import/churn metrics. |
| [BR04](./findings/BR04-esbuild-risk-deferral.md) | reviewed-deferred | Esbuild may help build speed, but bundling is deferred. If reopened, start transpile-only. |

## What Changed

Implemented guardrails:

- `npm run verify:package-boundary`
- `npm run verify:package-boundary:dist`
- `packages/soul-core/package.json` declares `publishConfig.access = public`
- P7 docs now encode public package vs embedded private lib boundaries.

No broad runtime behavior rewrite was accepted.

## What Did Not Change

- Browser remains a complete optional extension capability.
- Browser Harness remains an implementation asset of that extension.
- `models.generated.ts` remains monolithic until metrics justify generator-backed chunking.
- The build pipeline remains `tsc`-based.
- Provider request payloads, prompts, token accounting, model selection, and extension loader behavior are not intentionally changed by P7.

## Why Not Continue P7 Code Now

### BR02: Browser

Moving raw Browser Harness assets to a package optimizes first install size but worsens first-use UX. Users think in terms of the Browser extension, not an extension shell plus an asset package.

Future move condition:

```text
package the whole Browser extension only after a first-class install/enable UX exists
```

### BR03: Model Metadata

`models.generated.ts` is large in lines but small when compressed. It is a startup/import/churn question, not a release-boundary emergency.

Future move condition:

```text
capture startup/import/churn metrics and preserve sync getModel/getModels/getProviders
```

### BR04: Esbuild

Esbuild's strongest benefits require bundling or minification, which can disturb internal package embedding, extension aliases, dynamic imports, and asset-relative paths.

Future move condition:

```text
prove a concrete build/startup/size target; start with transpile-only, no bundling
```

## Validation State

P7 static validation:

```bash
npm run verify:package-boundary
```

P7 capable-machine validation:

```bash
npm run build
npm run verify:package-boundary:dist
npm publish --dry-run --tag beta
npm install -g @pencil-agent/nano-pencil@beta
catui -v
```

Notes:

- prerelease publishes must use `npm publish --tag beta`.
- `npm publish --dry-run` for prerelease versions also needs `--tag beta`.
- If a size win is claimed later, attach tarball and unpacked before/after data.

## Reopen Matrix

| Reopen Area | Required Evidence | First Allowed Slice |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Browser package move | User-facing install/enable UX exists and browser opt-in smoke is defined | Move/package whole Browser extension, not raw harness assets |
| Model metadata chunking | Startup/import/churn metrics justify generator complexity | Generated provider chunks plus sync aggregate compatibility wrapper |
| Esbuild | Build/startup/size target is measured and unmet by safer slices | Transpile-only esbuild plus TypeScript declarations; no bundling |

## 2026-06-10 Addendum — size metrics + first size slice

A "package size" request reopened the size line. **Measured before acting** (the
gate BR03 demanded):

### BR03 (model metadata chunking) — measured, NOT pursued

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `models.generated.js` import/parse | ~30–43ms (one-time) on a now ~1.9s startup |
| built JS | 460K raw / **24K gzip** |
| providers / models | 25 / 846 |

Verdict: chunking into per-provider files behind a **sync** aggregate index (the
only API-preserving option; async load is rejected) **still eager-imports every
chunk** → parse cost unchanged, and 25 small files gzip to ~the same 24K (file
headers may even grow it). models.generated is **~1.3% of the 1.8MB tarball**.
BR03 delivers no size/startup win — only generator-churn localization. **Not
done.** The metrics gate is now satisfied with data: keep the monolith.

The real tarball weight is browser `agent-workspace` markdown (~1.6M) — that is
BR02, still UX-gated.

### BR05 (implemented) — strip embedded runtime-lib `.d.ts`

`scripts/copy-internal-libs.js` copied the full `dist` of each internal lib
(`@pencil-agent/{ai,agent-core,tui}`) into `dist/node_modules/`, including `.d.ts`
and `.map`. Those libs are embedded **purely for runtime `require.resolve` (.js)**:
the host's own type-check resolves them via the root workspace symlink to
`core/lib/*` (source, keeps `.d.ts`), and consumers resolve types from
`dist/index.d.ts` — TS never reads a package's nested `dist/node_modules`. So the
embedded declarations are dead weight. Added a copy filter dropping
`.d.ts`/`.d.*ts`/`.map`.

Same-dist before/after (`npm pack`):

| Metric | before | after | Δ |
|--------|--------|-------|---|
| files | 1075 | 988 | **−87** (the embedded .d.ts) |
| gzip tarball | 1,805,318 B | 1,750,161 B | **−55,157 B (−3.05%)** |
| unpacked | 7.5 MB | 6.9 MB | −589K |

Behavior-neutral: `verify:package-boundary:dist` green (embed still resolves),
`--list-models` loads the embedded ai registry, `verify:quality`/`verify:dip`
green. Bigger size lever remaining is dist `.js` minify (BR04 transpile/minify-only,
separate risk decision).

## 2026-06-11 Addendum — BR04 minify (implemented, transpile-only)

BR04 reopened per its gate ("start transpile-only, no bundling"). Implemented as
`scripts/minify-dist.js` (`npm run minify:dist`, final step of `npm run build`):
esbuild **transform** API per file, `minify: true, keepNames: true`. This is a
per-file transform, **not a bundle** — import/export statements and module
boundaries are byte-for-byte preserved, so the embedded private-lib strategy,
jiti aliases, dynamic imports, and asset-relative paths are untouched.
`keepNames` keeps Function/class `.name` at runtime (stack traces, error
fingerprints, name-based wiring intact). Escape hatch: `CATUI_NO_MINIFY=1`.

Measured (same tree, before/after `npm pack`):

| Metric | before | after | Δ |
|--------|--------|-------|---|
| raw dist .js | 4645K | 2251K | **−52%** |
| gzip tarball | 1,733,504 B | 1,387,300 B | **−346,204 B (−20%)** |
| unpacked | 7.1 MB | 4.6 MB | −2.5 MB |

Validated on a headless machine (the per-file-minify risk surface is all
load-time): `verify:package-boundary:dist` green (embedded libs resolve
minified), `--version`/`--help`/`--list-models` load the full graph, and all **25
builtin extensions load with 0 errors registering 35 tools**. NOT yet validated:
a live model turn (needs API key) and real-terminal TUI render — defer to the
pre-publish beta-smoke-checklist on a maintainer machine.

### BR02 (browser asset move) — measured, kept bundled

The browser `agent-workspace/domain-skills` (80 site-recipe markdown files, 1.6M
raw / **359K gzip**, ~26% of the *package* tarball) is the largest single asset.
But measured against **install footprint**, not package size:

| | size | share of install |
|---|---|---|
| domain-skills | 1.6M raw / 359K gzip | **~1%** |
| node_modules (deps) | ~275M (koffi 85M, openai 13M, AI SDKs, …) | the rest |

Decision (maintainer, 2026-06-11): **keep domain-skills bundled, do not move to
on-demand download.** The browser is a networked feature whose UX matters more
than 359K; an on-demand "downloading browser skills…" step would be perceptible
friction, and the byte savings are ~1% of an install dominated by the provider
SDKs + koffi. domain-skills also degrade gracefully when absent (`existsSync`
filter in `resources_discover`), so the bundle is not a correctness requirement —
it is purely the seamless-UX choice. If *install time* ever becomes the concern,
the levers are koffi (85M, optional FFI) and the AI provider SDKs, not this asset.

## P7 size line — CLOSED (2026-06-11)

| Slice | Outcome |
|-------|---------|
| BR01 package-boundary guard | ✅ implemented |
| BR04 per-file minify | ✅ implemented (−346K/−20% tarball) |
| BR05 embedded .d.ts strip | ✅ implemented (−55K) |
| BR03 model metadata chunking | measured → ~0 win, not pursued |
| BR02 browser asset move | measured → ~1% of install, kept bundled (UX) |

Net shipped tarball reduction this cycle: ~−400K gzip (BR04 + BR05). The remaining
big asset (browser domain-skills) is a deliberate UX-over-size keep. No further P7
size work is open.

## Handoff

P7 can be treated as closed for the current refactor branch once:

- BR01 guard passes on the release machine.
- fresh beta install has no extension/package load errors.
- maintainers accept that BR02-BR04 are gated follow-up work, not current-scope blockers.
