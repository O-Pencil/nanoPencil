# Entry & Volume Refactor Plan

```yaml
plan_for: entry-volume-review
parent: ./README.md
status: active   # P5 structurally complete (2026-06-04); P6 code unblocked. EV02 landed.
```

## Execution Rule

~~P6 code is blocked by P5.~~ **P5 结构完成（2026-06-04）** → P6 代码解锁。EV02（mode lazy dispatch）已落地；EV03 仍待 Q2；EV04 待 provider-matrix 议定。

```text
P5 interactive entry stable
  -> EV02 mode lazy dispatch
  -> EV03 browser opt-in (after Q2)
  -> EV04 provider lazy design/implementation (after provider matrix is agreed)
  -> EV05 package surface sign-off
```

## Slice Order

| Order | Slice | Finding | Code allowed now? | Notes |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| 0 | P6 review scaffolding | EV01-EV05 | docs only | Safe parallel work while another Agent changes P5 |
| 1 ✅ done | mode lazy dispatch | EV02 / F06 | **landed 2026-06-04** | main.ts only: dropped the eager `modes/index.ts` barrel import; rpc/interactive/print dispatch branches now `await import(...)` the selected runner (ACP already did). modes/index.ts barrel kept as public SDK surface (root index.ts re-exports it; EV-G4 — not narrowed). Cold-start measurement pending capable machine. See EV02 §Resolution |
| 2 | browser opt-in decision | EV03 / F07 / Q2 | docs only | Decide independent package vs lazy-extract vs status quo before moving files |
| 3 | browser optional implementation | EV03 | no, after Q2 | Moving builtin→optional is intentional behavior change; needs fallback UX and docs |
| 4 | ai provider lazy design | EV04 / F07 / Q6 | docs only | Split metadata/runtime concerns before touching `@pencil-agent/ai` |
| 5 | ai provider lazy implementation | EV04 | no, after provider matrix | Highest behavior risk: model availability, OAuth/env/custom providers, token usage |
| 6 | package surface review | EV05 / Q3 / P8 | docs only | Do not narrow root exports in P6 unless Q3 explicitly says so |

## Conflict Matrix With P5

| P6 Slice | P5 Conflict | Decision |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| mode lazy dispatch | Depends on final interactive entry/export shape | Wait for P5 stable `InteractiveMode` mount and controller wiring |
| browser opt-in | May affect extension-ui feature inventory and builtin extension expectations | Review now; code after P5 extension acceptance is stable |
| ai provider lazy | Cross-mode runtime/provider behavior, not direct P5 file conflict | Design now; implement only with full provider validation |
| package surface | Could interact with P5/P8 public exports and subpaths | Review now; implementation requires explicit compatibility decision |

## Acceptance Shape

Each code slice must record:

```text
Slice:
Cost moved:
Files touched:
Intentional behavior changes:
Compatibility notes:
Validation:
- mode smoke:
- browser fallback:
- provider matrix:
- cold start:
- dist size:
Residual risk:
```

## Near-Term Parallel Work

Safe while P5 is active:

- Maintain this review directory.
- Inspect import graphs by text search.
- Draft Q2 browser opt-in decision.
- Draft provider lazy matrix.
- Define measurement commands for a capable machine.

Not safe while P5 is active:

- Edit `main.ts` dispatch.
- Edit `modes/index.ts`.
- Move `extensions/builtin/browser`.
- Change package `files` or root exports.
- Change `core/lib/ai` provider/model loading.
