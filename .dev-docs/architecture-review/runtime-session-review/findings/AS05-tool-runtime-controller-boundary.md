# AS05: Tool runtime needs one dispatch owner before S1 can hold

```yaml
finding_id: AS05
severity: load-bearing
lenses: [seam, leverage, locality]
files_primary:
  - core/runtime/agent-session.ts
  - core/runtime/tool-runtime-controller.ts

```

## Problem

Tool setup crosses built-in tools, extension tools, MCP tools, active tool names, wrapping, and runtime rebuilds. P4's S1 says `ToolOrchestrator` must be the only dispatch point, but that cannot hold if `AgentSession` keeps assembling tool sets directly.

The risk is a split where dispatch is nominally centralized but activation and wrapping rules remain scattered.

## Deletion Test

> If a future `ToolRuntimeController` were deleted, would complexity concentrate?

**Result**: concentrates if it owns activation/wrapping/refresh; vanishes if it only forwards to `ToolOrchestrator`.

The module is justified only if it owns the policy around tool availability and tool source integration.

## Proposed Direction

Create a tool runtime boundary only when it can own:

- base tool registry
- static custom tools
- extension registered tools
- MCP refresh tools
- active tool name changes
- wrapping through extension hooks
- rebuild of agent tool list

`ToolOrchestrator` remains the single dispatch primitive; the controller owns runtime policy around it.

## Decision

2026-06-01: first consolidated the live runtime registry into `ToolOrchestrator`, then introduced `ToolRuntimeController` for source merge, extension wrapping, active-name policy, and registry updates. `AgentSession` still owns extension lifecycle, MCP refresh, prompt application, and final `agent.setTools(...)` facade wiring.

## Benefits

- **Leverage**: S1 becomes enforceable by code shape, not just documentation.
- **Locality**: adding tool runtime categories no longer requires editing `AgentSession`.

## Before / After Sketch

```
BEFORE
AgentSession assembles tools -> ToolOrchestrator dispatches

AFTER
AgentSession facade -> ToolRuntimeController -> ToolOrchestrator
```
