# AS10: navigateTree() should own tree navigation + branch summary

## Problem

`navigateTree()` (~206 lines — the single largest method left in `AgentSession`) owns a cohesive, self-contained workflow with **real state and real behavior**:

- **state**: the branch-summary abort slot `_branchSummarySlot` (currently still on `AgentSession`, alongside `abortBranchSummary()`)
- **tree positioning**: `collectEntriesForBranchSummary`, common-ancestor resolution, new-leaf determination
- **branch summarization**: `generateBranchSummary` with model/API-key access, abort handling, settings
- **extension override**: `session_before_tree` with mutable `customInstructions`/`replaceInstructions`/`label`, optional extension-provided summary
- **mutation + restore**: navigate to target leaf, attach summary entry at the target, replace agent messages, emit `session_tree`

Unlike `fork()` (which creates a new session file), `navigateTree()` stays in the **same** file and moves the leaf — it is a distinct branch/tree concern.

## Deletion Test

> If a `SessionTreeController` were deleted, would behavior return to `AgentSession` or scatter?

**Result**: it returns to `AgentSession` as one method. It does **not** scatter into modes or other controllers — branch-summary state and tree positioning are used nowhere else. This is exactly the "owns real state + real behavior" signal RS-5 wants.

## Verdict — SELECTED (next slice)

Extract a `SessionTreeController` that owns:

- `navigateTree()`
- `abortBranchSummary()`
- the `_branchSummarySlot` (moved off `AgentSession`)

After this slice, `AgentSession` holds **no abort slots** (compaction slots already moved to `CompactionController` in AS04; this moves the last one).

The controller reads the session through a narrow `SessionTreeControllerContext` (capabilities: get model / API key / branch entries / leaf id / entry by id, branch-summary settings, `session_before_tree` + `session_tree` emission, navigate-to-leaf + attach-summary via session manager, rebuild/replace agent messages). It must not import `agent-session.ts`.

## Decision Criteria

- `SessionTreeController` does not import `agent-session.ts`
- context exposes named capabilities, not whole `AgentSession`
- no mode imports the controller; `navigateTree()`/`abortBranchSummary()` stay callable through `AgentSession`
- `session_before_tree` cancellation/override and `session_tree` emission order unchanged
- abort behavior (`abortBranchSummary`) and the abort-slot lifecycle are identical
- branch-summary generation, target-leaf positioning, and summary-entry attachment behavior are byte-identical
- `_branchSummarySlot` is fully owned by the controller (no residual reference in `AgentSession`)
