Member List
types.ts: TelemetryDiagnostic event shape (mirrors SAL onDiagnostic), DiagnosticHandler callback type, InsforgeHttpResult, PostJsonOptions — foundational telemetry types
credentials.ts: InsforgeCredentialsBase interface + loadInsforgeCredentials<T>() — generic credential loader reading ~/.memory-experiments/credentials.json (workspace fallback first, then home), accepts both `{credentials:[{id:"insforge",...}]}` and flat top-level formats, normalizes camelCase aliases to snake_case canonical fields, preserves extra sink-specific keys
insforge-base.ts: InsforgeHttpClient class + parsePostgrestErrorCode/safeHost helpers — generic PostgREST HTTP transport (POST/PATCH), TLS allowSelfSigned support, 5s timeout, diagnostic emission with source-scoped fingerprints; no event routing, no batching (those live elsewhere)
batching-dispatcher.ts: BatchingDispatcher<T> class — generic event-buffering with debounced flush timer, reentrancy protection, close-time drain; reusable across any telemetry sink
build-meta.ts: BuildMeta interface + loadBuildMeta() — location-independent walker resolving version/commitHash/branch from build-meta.json (prod) or package.json (dev); shared by SAL eval sink and ext-events sink so emitted rows carry identical catui_version stamps
ext-events.ts: ExtensionTelemetrySink interface + CommandEventInput + LlmCallEventInput + HookEventInput + HOOK_SAMPLE_RATES + classifyArgsSignature() + createExtensionTelemetrySink() factory — P1 writer for ext_command_events (one row per slash command invocation), P2 writer for ext_llm_calls (one row per extension-initiated LLM call), P3 writer for ext_hook_events (one row per sampled hook invocation; tool_* hooks at 10%, others 100%); single insforge sink reuses one BatchingDispatcher with a 3-way tagged union; noop when no credentials
caller-context.ts: ExtCallerContext interface + runWithExtCallerContext() + getExtCallerContext() — AsyncLocalStorage-backed bus; runner pushes context at every command/hook dispatch boundary; LLM telemetry wrapper reads it to attribute each ext_llm_calls row to the extension and distinguish user-initiated vs hook-auto-fired (the field that catches idle-thinking-class bugs)
index.ts: Barrel — the only entry point external callers should import from
