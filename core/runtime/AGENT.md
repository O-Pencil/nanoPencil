Member List
event-bus.ts: EventBus interface, EventBusController, createEventBus(), typed event emission system for extension hooks, key methods: emit(), on() returns unsubscribe function
sdk.ts: createAgentSession(options) factory, creates all services with dependency injection, wires up extensions, applies loop framework/policy overrides, consumed by all run modes (interactive/print/rpc)
agent-session.ts: AgentSession class, central session lifecycle manager, wraps Agent from agent-core, coordinates compaction, in-loop recovery and recoverable error-tail pruning, forwards agent_result telemetry to extensions, exposes runtime loop policy updates, handles model switching, all modes delegate to this class
default-tools.ts: createDefaultRuntimeTools(), default read/bash/edit/write/time tool wiring with settings-aware image/shell/write-boundary configuration
extension-core-bindings.ts: bindExtensionCore(), adapts AgentSession host capabilities into ExtensionRunner action/context APIs
slash-command-catalog.ts: buildSessionSlashCommands(), buildExtensionSlashCommands(), shared slash command catalog assembly for runtime and extension views
turn-context.ts: Generic per-turn hint bus on globalThis, TURN_CONTEXT_GLOBAL_KEY, TurnContext interface (currently structuralAnchor), setTurnContext/getTurnContext/resetTurnContext; producer-side API for SAL→mem-core decoupling (mem-core has read-only mirror at packages/mem-core/src/turn-context.ts using same global key)
pencil-agent.ts: PencilAgent helper class wrapping Agent core
retry-coordinator.ts: Retry coordination for transient failures, including post-agent_continue retry and in-loop retry preparation
bash-runner.ts: BashRunner class — bash execution + pending-message queue extracted from AgentSession (P4.1); deps injected as closures (getCwd/getShellCommandPrefix/appendToAgent/appendToSession/isStreaming), no Agent/SessionManager import
session-context.ts: ModelControllerContext, ModelSelectPayload, and ScopedModel contracts; narrow capability seam for runtime controllers
model-controller.ts: ModelController, CycleModelError, ModelCycleResult, owns model set/cycle/restore and thinking-level mutations formerly embedded in AgentSession
thinking-levels.ts: pure thinking-level logic extracted from AgentSession (P4.2) — THINKING_LEVELS(_WITH_XHIGH), modelSupportsThinking/Xhigh, availableThinkingLevels, clampThinkingLevel, nextThinkingLevel; no session state, reusable by rpc/print
model-cycle.ts: pure model-cycle decisions extracted from AgentSession (P4.2) — pickThinkingLevelOnModelChange, nextCyclicIndex; side effects are owned by model-controller.ts
