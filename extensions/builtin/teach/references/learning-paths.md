# Learning Paths

Structured curricula for learners at different levels.
Each path is a recommended sequence of topics that build on each other.

## How to Use

1. **Assess learner level** first (see teach-runtime.ts § Learner Level Detection)
2. **Recommend a path**: "Based on your foundation, I recommend starting with Path A"
3. **Go topic by topic**: Each topic is independent enough to pause/resume
4. **After each topic**: Summarize key takeaways, suggest next topic
5. **Adjust pace**: If a topic feels too easy → skip to next. Too hard → explain specific confusion
6. **Track progress**: Use Session Memory to note completed topics and suggest next

---

## Quick Start Recommendations

| Learner says | Recommend |
|---|---|
| "I know nothing about this" | Path A, start at A1 |
| "I want to learn basic operations" | Path B, start at B1 |
| "I want deep understanding" | Path C, start at C1 |
| "I just want to learn one specific thing" | Direct teaching, no path |
| "I want systematic learning" | Recommend Path A/B/C based on level |

---

## Custom Paths

Learners can create custom paths:

1. Ask learner what they want to achieve
2. Break down into logical sequence
3. Estimate duration for each topic
4. Create custom path document
5. Track progress in session memory

## Path Selection Guide

### When to recommend Path A (Foundations)
- Learner says "I know nothing"
- Learner uses basic terminology incorrectly
- Learner asks very basic questions
- No prior experience mentioned

### When to recommend Path B (Practical Skills)
- Learner knows the basics
- Learner wants to apply knowledge
- Learner asks "how to" questions
- Some experience mentioned

### When to recommend Path C (Deep Understanding)
- Learner already has practical experience
- Learner asks "why" questions
- Learner wants to understand trade-offs
- Significant experience mentioned

## Adapting Paths

Paths are guidelines, not rigid rules. Adapt based on:

1. **Learner's pace**: If they're fast, skip ahead. If slow, add more examples.
2. **Learner's interests**: If they're more interested in one area, spend more time there.
3. **Learner's goals**: If they have a specific goal, focus on relevant topics.
4. **Learner's feedback**: If they say "I already know this", move on.
