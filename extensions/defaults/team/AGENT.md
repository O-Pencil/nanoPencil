## Phase B: AgentTeam Architecture

This extension implements the Phase B "true AgentTeam" per the refactor plan and the next-step conversational team UI:
- Persistent teammates with durable state (survive across main session restarts)
- Each teammate has identity, stable short label, mode, status, worktree, and message history
- Teammates run in isolated worktrees (for implementers)
- Uses core/sub-agent/ infrastructure for actual agent spawning
- Main chat renders a speaker stream (`pencil`, `Mason`, `Ada`, `Theo`, `Iris`, `Quinn`, ...) instead of raw status events
- Leader orchestration can auto-split `/team <task>` into teammate assignments and follow `@mention` handoffs

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/team` | List all teammates |
| `/team:spawn <role> [--name <id>]` | Create a persistent teammate |
| `/team:send <name> <message>` | Send message to a teammate |
| `/team:status [<name>]` | Show team or teammate status |
| `/team:stop <name>` | Stop teammate's current turn |
| `/team:terminate <name>` | Destroy a teammate |
| `/team:approve <request-id>` | Approve a permission request |
| `/team:mode <name> <plan\|execute\|review>` | Switch teammate mode |
| `/team:task list` | Show shared team tasks |
| `/team:task add <title>` | Add a shared task |
| `/team:task claim <id> <name>` | Assign/claim a task for a teammate |
| `/team:task done\|block\|cancel <id>` | Update task status |
| `/team:mail <from> <to> <message>` | Route teammate-to-teammate mailbox message |
| `/team:allow-path <name> <path>` | Grant teammate write access to a path prefix |

## Roles

- `researcher`: Read-only exploration
- `reviewer`: Read-only review/audit
- `implementer`: Sandboxed write in isolated worktree
- `planner`: Read-only plan production
- `generic`: Read-only by default

## Modes

- `research`: Read-only exploration
- `plan`: Read-only plan production; execute requires leader approval
- `execute`: Sandboxed write in worktree
- `review`: Read-only review

## State Persistence

Teammate state is stored in `~/.nanopencil/agent/teams/<uuid>.json`:
- Identity (id, name, role, createdAt)
- Mode and status
- Working directory and worktree info
- Message history
- Last activity timestamp

Shared team coordination state is also stored under `~/.nanopencil/agent/teams/`:
- `tasks.json`: durable task list with status, owner, dependencies, and artifact paths
- `mailbox.jsonl`: replayable mailbox events for leader↔teammate and teammate↔teammate routing

TeamStateStore is deliberately independent of core SessionManager per the refactor plan:
> "team-state-store 自己负责 teammate 历史 ... SessionManager 只负责主会话"

## Core Dependencies

- `core/sub-agent/`: SubAgentRuntime for spawning agents
- `core/workspace/`: WorktreeManager for isolated worktrees
- `core/tools/`: Tool creation with sandboxed bash

## Phase B status

Shipped in this iteration:
- Permission request/response (`team-permissions.ts`, wired into `/team:mode` execute escalation and `/team:approve`)
- Durable shared task list (`team-task-store.ts`, wired into `/team:task`)
- Mailbox protocol (`team-mailbox.ts`, posts on send/result/mode_change/permission_request/permission_response/task_update/task_claim/teammate_message and replays across restarts)
- Prompt context injection: each teammate receives claimed tasks, blocked/open task cues, and recent mailbox messages before every turn
- Path-scoped write allowlist exposed through `/team:allow-path`; execute-mode edit/write tools and simple bash write commands enforce teammate cwd or approved path prefixes
- Per-teammate send queue: concurrent `/team:send` calls for the same teammate run sequentially instead of failing while the teammate is running
- Per-teammate JSONL transcripts (`team-transcript.ts`)
- Structured speaker-stream utterances with `speaker/role/kind/mentions`
- Stable internal labels and mention-aware handoff parsing for leader-visible routing
- Subprocess SubAgent backend harness (`core/sub-agent/subprocess-backend.ts` + `subprocess-worker.ts`) — interface complete, worker LLM loop deferred (see backend doc).

Future work:
- Worker-side full LLM agent loop for the subprocess backend
- Broaden bash write parsing beyond simple single-command forms while keeping complex shell syntax rejected by default
