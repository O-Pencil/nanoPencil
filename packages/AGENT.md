# packages/ -- Bundled Published Packages

> P2 | Parent: ../AGENT.md

---

## Overview

The `packages/` directory now contains only bundled packages that remain outside
the internal `core/lib/` library layer after the phase-one skeleton move.

`@catui/ai`, `@catui/agent-core`, and `@catui/tui` were moved
to `core/lib/{ai,agent-core,tui}` and remain private workspace libraries.

## Boundary Rule

`packages/` packages are still package-shaped integration surfaces. Internal
non-published libraries belong under `core/lib/`.
