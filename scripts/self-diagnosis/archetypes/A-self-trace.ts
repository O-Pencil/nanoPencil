 * Lessons baked in from the 2026-05-17 first run (see .dev-docs/self-awareness/charter.md §7):
 *   - Hard sentinel: the prompt MUST instruct catui to stop after the sentinel and not continue.
 *   - No SAL eval interference: this archetype's run uses variant='self-diagnosis', not 'sal'.
 *   - Schema-cast guidance embedded: catui_issue_events / eval_tool_traces still all-TEXT
 *     until the migration in step B lands.
